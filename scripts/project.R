# Overview ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# Hi Darren,
#
# Please see attached a onedrive link for the database. Additonal author (Upinder) has kindly sent on their database so I am currently adding the details to the various tabs, so there may be somem change in data in drugs and presentation tabs.  Ultimately, I think what we need to try and do is pool the rates of ADRs and ascertain an I2 value re the suitability to look at the medications and presentations together.
#
# What we would like to report is;
# 1.	What is the pooled proportion of ADRs for in-hospital > 65 years with CI
# a.	in papers that were solely >65 vs all ages were there differences in this % and can we make a call on significance?
#   2.	What drug class / agents were most frequently reported as causative
# 3.	What clincial presentations are most common
# 4.	Overall proportions of severity
# 5.	Overall proportion of assessed preventability
